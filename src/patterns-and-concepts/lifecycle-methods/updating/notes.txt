        Updating lifecycle methods ( phase )


1. static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
    
    - called every time a component is re-rendered
    - can set the state

2. shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)

    - return boolean which will dictate if the component should be re-endered or not
    - for performance optimization
    - rarely used

3. render 

    - read props & state and return JSX

4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)

    - called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are 
        to be reflected in the real DOM
    - return null or value which will be passed as the third parameter to the next
        lifecycle method
    - rarely used

5. componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)

    - called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles
    - guaranteed called only once within one render cycle
